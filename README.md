# Drug-Prediction
This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict which of five drugs a patient might respond to, based on features like Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Sodium-to-Potassium ratio (Na_to_K). It automates drug prescription, helping in the decision-making process using patient health data.
